|----------------------------------------------------|

[INTRODUCTION]

Battleships Forever is a full featured space Real Time Strategy game. It features a wide range of ships to choose from (and to fight against!), each armed to the teeth with a variety of innovative weapons.

You are strongly encouraged to play the first Career Mission, Milk Run, as an introduction to the basic mechanics of Battleships Forever.

When you are ready for it, you should try the Skirmish game modes and compete with other players around the world to score the highest scores in Grinder or Blockade.


[SHIP MAKER]

A custom ship maker is available as part of this package. With this tool, you can create your own ships to play with in the Custom game modes.

If you wish, you can share your creations at the online Custom Ship Database at my website (http://www.wyrdysm.com)

Thank you for playing the game.

[WINDOWS VISTA USERS]
Note that you have to install the game to "C:\Users\Username\Battleships Forever\" (where Username is your username) or you may experience problems with the game.
